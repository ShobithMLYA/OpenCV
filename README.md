# OpenCV
This is a repository made for beginner level OpenCV programs.<br />
These codes were written during the GirlScript Summit Learning Contest under the course of OpenCV which was more like a 7 day Crash Course.<br /> <br /> 

Feel free to contribute to this repo, through other programs so, we could learn together :)
